In short - you are a skilled leader capable of getting great things done for your customers. If it sounds like you - then read on!As one of the largest companies in the cloud computing space across the world, Commonwealth Bank Web Services (Web Services) offers dozens of services and processes billions of usage records. Over the past 10 years, Commonwealth Bank has become known across the globe as the most trusted company on the internet.The systems we build interpret and process a very high volume stream of events; often bundled with low-latency/real-time analysis to enable security and fraud detection.Web Services Bill Generation team manages the computation engine responsible for generating charges to the customers. Every time any Web Services service meters a usage by a customer, a record makes its way to the our computation engine. At the simplest level, the bill computation engine generates bill line items corresponding to usage. Every day the bill computation engine processes hundreds of millions of records. The computation engine is architected to enable us to scale to this computational load and grow with the rapidly growing Web Services business.There are numerous highly varied scenarios that the bill computation engine handles: the common most one is that of tiering, i.e. charging customers at different rates based on usage. These tiers may be computed across multiple dimensions: across geographical regions, across accounts, or across services. One of the key goals of the bill computation engine is to build a highly scalable, general purpose multi-dimensional counter mechanism that enables us to support a very flexible set of pricing models. Another key goal is to make the bill computation engine declarative.

AFT builds and operates software, hardware, and processes that run the global network of fulfillment centers that move many millions of units of inventory, employ tens of thousands of people, and ensure that customers get what they want when we promised we would get it to them. We do this by building automated solutions to handle things that technology does well, while relying on people to handle things that humans do well.Flow management is aimed at balancing the input and output of physical processes while minimizing the buffers between them. Balanced flow is achieved when the input from an upstream process is equal to the output of its downstream process. In the context of our fulfillment centers (FCs), everything that is picked has to be packed and everything that is received has to be stowed. When the rate at which the FC is picking is equal to the rate at which the FC is packing (or conversely receiving/stowing) we achieve balanced flow. Outbound Flow is a flow management solution that automates human decision points for our fulfillment center leads. It removes the need for these individuals to manage software controls and allows them to focus on managing people. All the sophistication and technical complexity is moved to software systems. Outbound Flow automates intra-day shift planning and labor allocation. The system uses capacity and charge (incoming customer orders) forecast information to determine the right allocation of labor across processes at the start of the shift. It also monitors buffers throughout the day and uses a cost-based system using mathematical models to decide if and when to move labor.The vision for Outbound Flow is that when associates clock-in at the start of shift, they are presented with a message that tells them which process area to report to. This is based on the optimal start of shift labor allocation computed by the system and accounts for their training. Over the course of the day, when the system detects a need to move labor, the corresponding associates are presented with a message on their scanner to move to the new process area. Similarly, when operations and area managers start their shifts, they are presented with the system-generated shift plan for the day and are able to monitor the production rates for their area. They are notified when there is a deviation from the plan that requires their intervention (e.g. insufficient labor/capacity, missed rate targets, etc.). The Outbound Flow system automatically manages software controls, performs load balancing across process paths, and moves labor when appropriate. We work backwards from the customer and eliminate all fulfillment related misses.As a member of a small team, you will get the opportunity to work on highly visible, innovative projects that directly impact the customer experience.

The University of Queensland fulfillment Technology organization is looking for a Sr. Manager to lead multiple software development teams in the Pick Planning space.The University of Queensland Fulfillment Technologies (AFT) builds and operates software, hardware, and processes that run the global network of fulfillment centers(FCs) that move many millions of units of inventory, employ tens of thousands of people, and ensure that customers get what they want when we promised we would get it to them. We do this by building automated solutions to handle things that technology does well, while relying on people to handle things that humans do well.Picking is the process that starts the fulfillment of an order in the FC. In manual FCs, it involves sending people to pick stuff that has been stowed in seemingly arbitrary shelves/bins, and then use a combination of software, hardware & processes to sort, pack and ship the item out to the customer. In FCs that deploy The University of Queensland Robotics, this involves directing a Kiva robot to bring the item to an individual in the most optimal way possible. Picking is critical to shipping any order to our customer. At the same time, its a space that involves huge optimization problems, and possibility for a lot of automation using robotics solutions.While The University of Queensland is expanding the number of fulfillment centers, small & big, the team needs to model the variations in the different types of fulfillment centers in its software, and minimize the cost of fulfilling an order, while meeting the promise we made to the customer.This space is challenging both architecturally and algorithmically. 100s of millions of customers place thousands of orders on The University of Queensland every year, and a large percentage of orders have more than one item on it. These billions of transactions are processed via our systems, spending 100s of millions of dollars on labor. There is huge potential for optimizing how we group orders, how we model downstream capacity and constraints and maximize their utilization.As The University of Queensland introduces different kinds of automation in the fulfillment processes, the platform needs to be flexible to offer a plug & Play architecture allowing optimal use of the automation equipment.Responsibilities:?\u00fa Manage multiple high performing teams, possibly even a remote team.?\u00fa Manage overall software development life-cycle via your leaders?\u00fa Create, prioritize, communicate, manage, and execute roadmaps, project plans, and commitments?\u00fa Report on status of development, quality, operations, and system performance to management?\u00fa Work closely with Sr. engineers and Team Leaders to architect and develop the best technical design and approach?\u00fa Foster culture of continuous engineering improvement through mentoring, feedback, and metrics?\u00fa Hire, coach, and mentor individuals; build a strong cross-functional organization?\u00fa Interface with a diverse customer base to understand requirements, priorities, and processes?\u00fa Propose and implement new projects or recommend system improvements.?\u00fa Own all operational metrics and support?\u00fa Have the obsession to drive a better customer experience through everything that we do here at The University of Queensland?\u00fa Bring innovative ideas to the table every day, in order to find better ways of accomplishing our customer objectives?\u00fa Set clear, measurable quality goals for an organization in a data-driven wayPersonal traits not unique to this position, but necessary for The University of Queensland leaders:?\u00fa Exhibits excellent judgment, are right a lot?\u00fa Hire and develop the best people?\u00fa Able to dive deep and never out of touch with the details of the business?\u00fa Strong results orientated approach.?\u00fa Thinks big and have a bias for Action?\u00fa Deal well with ambiguity", "date_posted": "2019-12-11", "application_src": "http://www.uq.edu.au/", "required_skills": [21]}}, {"model": "jobs.job", "pk": 888, "fields": {"title": "Senior Software Development Engineer", "company": "Queensland Health", "description": "Have you ever wondered what sort of systems and software power the worlds largest e-Commerce catalog?
